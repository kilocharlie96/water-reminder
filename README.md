# 💧 **Water Reminder – Simple, Fast, Reactive**

  Water Reminder is a lightweight web application that reminds users to stay hydrated throughout the day. It is designed not only as a helpful tool, but also as a demonstration of how simple and effective frontend reactivity can be using HTMX — without the overhead of frameworks like React.


### **</> Built with HTMX for Speed and Simplicity**

  While modern frontend development often defaults to complex solutions like React, this app proves that reactivity doesn’t have to be complicated. Using HTMX, UI interactions are dynamic and fast, yet the codebase remains clean, declarative, and easy to maintain.

  HTMX allows partial page updates and interactivity directly from HTML attributes, reducing the need for boilerplate code and build steps.

  ✅ **No virtual DOM, no build tools, no client-side routing — just instant interactivity.**

JavaScript is used only where truly needed — for example, to manage timers and local data — keeping logic modular and focused.
